# Alaska: Automated and friendly RNA-seq analysis
Version: v1.2.0

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a way to quantify differential gene expression and is used to discover novel gene functions and pathways. Although the molecular biology behind RNA-seq is fully understood, analysis of the data remains a significant bottleneck. Here, we introduce a RNA-seq framework that will allow analysis within hours of an RNA-seq experiment.
